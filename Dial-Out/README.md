# Dial-Out

  This app shows how to connect to an OpenTok session, publish a stream, subscribe to **multiple streams**, and use OpenTok SIP Interconnect with Nexmo to call a phone number.

## Configuring the application

Before running the application, you need to configure the following credentials:
  * OpenTok
    * OpenTok API Key
    * OpenTok API Secret
  * Nexmo
    * Nexmo Long Virtual number
    * Nexmo API Key
    * Nexmo API Secret

Copy the contents of `config.example.js` file into a new file called `config.js`.  

```
  module.exports = {
    apiKey: '', // TokBox apiKey
    apiSecret: '', // TokBox apiSecret
    sip: {
      from: '', // Nexmo Long virtual number in xxxxxx@nexmo.com format
      username: '', // Nexmo apiKey
      password: '', // Nexmo apiSecret
  };
```

You should use your OpenTok Key and Secret as the `apiKey` and `apiSecret` values and your Nexmo API Key as the sip `username` and Nexmo API Secret as the sip `password`.

## Setting up OpenTok & Nexmo projects
  For OpenTok:
  * Create an API Project to get the API Key and Secret.

  For Nexmo:
  * Sign up for a [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/) account to get the API Key and Secret. 
  
Optionally, you can also rent a Long Virtual Number (LVN) from Nexmo or your preferred provider to use it for Call Line Identifier (CLI). This LVN can be set in the  from field to be used as a CLI. Although, this step is not mandatory, however, the downstream carriers may reject the call if the correct CLI has not been specified as explained in [this article](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204015273-Does-Nexmo-support-CLI-Caller-ID-for-my-voice-calls) 

  
## Starting the application
